It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam and Puerto Rico, as well as reflectivity and velocity data from Environment Canada radars. These aren't smoothed PNG or GIF images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial NEXRAD weather radar on your iOS device and Apple Watch.\n\nWhen there are any Tornado Warnings (outlined in RED), Severe Thunderstorm Warnings (YELLOW polygons), or Flash Flood Warnings (GREEN polygons) in effect throughout the US, tap the warning button in the top right corner to browse the list of current warnings, view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map. \n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out.

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \n\nWe can\u2019t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\n\nTo celebrate the 7th anniversary of that incredible moment in flatulence history, iFart scientists completely rebuilt the backend of the app and released our biggest update ever!\n\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart\u2122.\n\n* SECURITY FART *\n\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\n\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\n\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\n\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\n\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\n\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\n\n* RECORD-A-FART *\n\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \n\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\n\nUsing iFart\u2019s \u201cRecord-A-Fart\u201d feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\n\n* FART NOW *\n\nThe World Today is a very stressful place. Stress causes medical problems, eating disorders, drug addiction, and leads to divorce and broken homes.\n\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWell Folks... there is.. and it's FART NOW. \n\nSimply scroll to your preferred sound effect and hit Fart Now.

{"name":"Peekaboo Barn","size_bytes":50155520,"price":1.99,"ver":"5.1.0","cont_rating":"4+","description":"Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out!\u00a0More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find a new animal animation, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills. \u00a0\n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world\u2014or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the language of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n\u2014Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n\u2014World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, and UK English. \n\u2014Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn. \u00a0Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE\u00a0\nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over half a million times, and played over 70 million times worldwide. \u00a0It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often. \u00a0It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011. \u00a0It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland\u2019s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we\u2019ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy!\u00a0\n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo Barn, check out our awesome sequels: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Sesame Street, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild. \n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com\/nightanddaystudios.\u00a0\nTwitter: @nightdaystudios\u00a0\nYour privacy is important to us!

Wind Meter works by measuring the volume of wind flowing over your iPhone microphone and converting it into an effective wind speed reading in REAL TIME at your location!      \n                                       \nAs quoted by: KITELIFE MAGAZINE -\n\n\"In our own field tests here at KITELIFE, we found that in a relatively consistent wind speed of 3-28 mph, the Wind Meter app was surprisingly accurate.\"\n\nAs quoted by: BLUE WATER SAILING MAGAZINE - \n \n\"We were really jazzed to see this new wind speed app for the iPhone and downloaded it right away. It is really cool and will be appreciated by sailors everywhere.\"\n\nAs quoted by: PANBO MARINE ELECTRONICS -  \n\n\"Would you believe it? -- it actually works.  I was out testing and photographing the NMEA 2000 wind rig early this morning and thus could compare Wind Meter to a consensus of five high quality sensors mounted just a few feet over my head\".   \nBen Ellison - PANBO MARINE ELECTRONICS\n\nAs quoted by: ROBERT JOHNSON MEN'S MID-d & DISTANCE COACH, CORNELL UNIVERSITY CO-FOUNDER, LETSRUN.COM - \n\n\"As a Division 1 Track Coach and operator of LetsRun.com, I was stunned to learn that the iphone could measure wind speed. This app works as advertised and is a lot of fun to take to a track meet.\"    Robert Johnson - CORNELL UNIVERSITY\n\nOTHER REAL WORLD USERS:\n\n\u201cWas at Seaside on the weekend and a guy had the app. We put it up next to a wind meter and was only off from the wind meter by 1 mph--pretty impressed.\u201d\nReference: http:\/\/forums.ikitesurf.com\/viewtopic.php?t=12643\n\n\u201cWorks real good; pretty accurate side by side with other handheld meters. seems to have better averaging [as compared with skywatch]\u201d\nReference: http:\/\/forums.iwindsurf.com\/viewtopic.php?p=102262\n\n\"First Test Proved it For Me, Very clever app!  By chance it's blowing tonight, so I went up to our flat roof and stood a few feet below our Davis instruments anemometer. The Davis recorded a max gust of about 26 mph while the max I recorded with the Wind Meter was 23 mph. Had I climbed a ladder, I expect the readings would have been even closer.\"\n\nOPERATOR'S MANUAL:\n\nWhen you open the Wind Meter APP the screen will rotate so that the microphone end of the phone will now be on top. To obtain the best wind speed readings, simply hold the iphone upright and straight out to your side with the screen facing you, letting the wind slip over the top of the phone, and push Get Wind!  Wait at least 5-10 seconds and then push Got Wind!  The final reading is the average for the period. The Wind Meter estimates wind speeds from 4-28 mph.   We recommend that you test the Wind Meter for your particular iPhone or type of use, using only natural wind and a commercial grade anemometer for comparisons. While the default calibration is appropriate for many phones, if your iOS device appears to over or under measure, you can easily calibrate your phone's Wind Meter Application by pushing the Calibrate button.  Due to the necessary installation of a noise dampener, the Wind Meter is most effective in consistent winds. For the same reason, it begins to effectively estimate wind speeds that are above 5mph.  Additionally, Wind Meter cannot measure wind speeds over 28mph (hurricane strength winds) since this equates to the max decibel level an iPhone can detect. \n\nThis application is not intended to replace commercial grade anemometers or scientific instrumentation.\n  \nWind Meter supports multiple units of measure including Miles Per Hour, Knots, Kilometers Per Hour, Beaufort, Feet Per Second, and Meters Per Second.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.goingapps.com","genre":"Other"}
